# AI Programming Learning Questionnaire

This is a static frontend prototype for the questionnaire in `问卷2.1.docx`, styled after the provided PDF sample.

## Preview

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve this folder with any static server.

## Current Frontend Logic

- Each question page must be completed before the respondent can continue.
- There is no back button.
- A4, A5, A7, A8, and A9 end the questionnaire when the respondent selects a none/never option.
- Multiple-choice none/never options are exclusive.
- Each Likert table is shown as one page.
- English text appears first and Chinese text starts on a new line.
- Explanation text boxes stay on the same page as their corresponding table.
- Current submission behavior downloads a JSON file and saves the same payload to browser `localStorage`.

## Backend Collection Options

Recommended choices:

1. Google Sheets via Apps Script
   - Best for pilot studies and small sample sizes.
   - Easy to inspect and export responses.
   - Needs a simple Apps Script endpoint and CORS-safe submission.

2. Supabase
   - Best if you want a real database without much server setup.
   - Supports CSV export, authentication, and row-level security.
   - Good balance for academic study data.

3. Custom API plus PostgreSQL
   - Best for stricter control, audit logs, and larger deployment.
   - More setup and maintenance.

The frontend submission point is `downloadResponses()` in `app.js`. Replace the download behavior with `fetch("/api/responses", ...)` or a hosted endpoint once you choose the backend.

## Online Deployment Options

Recommended choices:

1. Netlify or Vercel
   - Best for quick public deployment.
   - Drag-and-drop or Git-based deploy.
   - Works well for this static frontend.

2. GitHub Pages
   - Free and simple for static hosting.
   - Good if the repository can be public or your organization supports private Pages.

3. University server
   - Best if ethics/data governance requires institutional hosting.
   - Usually needs coordination with IT.
